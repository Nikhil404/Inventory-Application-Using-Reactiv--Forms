# InventoryApp
I Have creating an application for managing an inventory using one of the third-party component libraries that was created by VMware's team, known as the Clarity component. It follows the Clarity Design System, which has detailed UX/UI guidelines that need to be followed for using the components correctly. It also documents do's and don'ts for using each of the components. You can find the documentation at https://clarity.design.

## Demo of the Project

## Run

## Development server

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
